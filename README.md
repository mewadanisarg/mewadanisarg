### Hi there, ðŸ‘‹

## About Me:

I have become very curious about web development since my bachelors studies and learn to code during that time. Although my background is not in IT, but I am a fun time learning and developing new things.

I am eager to work with a friendly team and want to go more deeper into Full-Stack web development this year.
